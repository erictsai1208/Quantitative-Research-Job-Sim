JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co. Quantitative Research

This is a self-paced study from https://www.theforage.com/simulations/jpmorgan/quantitative-research-11oc where I practice my analytical skills in a quantitative research setting. Throughout the tasks, I used various data science techniques such as data visualization for exploratory data analysis and developed a small supervised machine learning model to predict customer default.
